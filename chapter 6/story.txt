People think in narratives, in stories. That’s how
we understand the world.


We have an intimate grasp of characters, desires,
and motivations. Where we get into trouble is when we try to abstract out of
the main through-line discrete parts and deal with them out of context.


user story:
As a suburban
commuter …” versus “As a farmer in the South Dakota Badlands … ,”you
are going to end up with a very different interpretation of what the ideal
vehicle is.



Independent. The story must be actionable and “completable” on its own. It
shouldn’t be inherently dependent on another story.

Negotiable. Until it’s actually being done, it needs to be able to be rewritten.
Allowance for change is built in.

Valuable. It actually delivers value to a customer or user or stakeholder.
Estimable. You have to be able to size it.

Small. The story needs to be small enough to be able to estimate and plan
for easily. If it is too big, rewrite it or break it down into smaller stories.

Testable. The story must have a test it is supposed to pass in order to be
complete. Write the test before you do the story.


We find in real projects that if stories are really Ready, the team
will double the speed of implementation.


Also once you have your velocity, you can figure out the most important
thing in Scrum: what is keeping you from going faster?
