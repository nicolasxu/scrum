The mistake was because they made a very basic mistake. They thought they could
plan everything ahead of time.

Unfortunately, that calculation phase can be a garbage-in/garbage-out
process.


The people involved may be highly intelligent, and yet they typically
won’t realize that what they’re feeding into their planning charts is a lot of
wishful thinking.


But the key is to refine the plan throughout the project rather than
do it all up front.


Plan in just enough detail to deliver the next increment of
value, and estimate the remainder of the project in larger chunks.
