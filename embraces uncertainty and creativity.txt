Scrum embraces uncertainty and creativity. It places a structure around
the learning process, enabling teams to assess both what theyâ€™ve created and,
just as important, how they created it. The Scrum framework harnesses how
teams actually work and gives them the tools to self-organize and rapidly
improve both speed and quality of work.



No one should spend their lives on meaningless work.
Not only is it not good business, it kills the soul.
