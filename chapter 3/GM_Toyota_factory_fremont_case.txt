(NUMMI) automotive plant in Fremont, California
It was a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota


GM closed it becuase they considered the workforce the worst in America.
People drank on the job, didn’t show up for work, and
subtly sabotaged the cars putting a Coke bottle inside a
door, where it would rattle and annoy customers.


Toyota reopened the plant
in 1984. GM told them about how awful the workers were but that the
managers were great and they should rehire them. workforce—even
sent some of them to Japan to learn the Toyota Production System. 

Almost
immediately the NUMMI plant was producing cars with the same precision
and as few defects as cars that were produced in Japan. Same people,
different system.
