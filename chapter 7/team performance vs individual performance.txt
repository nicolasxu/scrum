I can double a team’s productivity
in a month, but an individual? That could take a year. And a whole bunch of
individuals? A whole division? A whole company? That could take forever.
So I use transparency to focus on improving the team.


So in Scrum, everything is visible. In my companies, every salary, every
financial, every expenditure is available to everyone.

Atomizing people into
informational silos simply slows everyone down.

It divides a company into the big boys who know stuff and the
peons who merely execute segments of some mysterious agenda they aren’t
capable of understanding.
