In Japanese the word used is kaizen, or
“improvement.”


What is the little improvement that can be done right away
that will make things better?

In Scrum this is captured at the end of each Sprint in what I call the
“Sprint Retrospective.”

To be effective, this Retrospective meeting requires a certain amount of emotional
maturity and an atmosphere of trust.

It’s not good
enough merely to share how you feel; you need to be able to act.


“Happiness Metric.”
1. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the
company?
2. On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a
whole?
3. Why do you feel that way?
4. What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?
