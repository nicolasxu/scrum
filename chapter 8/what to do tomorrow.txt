1. The first step is just putting together a Backlog and a team.

Think about the
vision you have for your product or service or whatever, and start breaking
down the things you need to do to execute that vision. You don’t need a
whole lot—just a week’s worth of Backlog.


The key message is that everything is being done in
the open. Anyone can see where your product is at any time. They can see
the stories move across the Scrum board to Done.


Scrum is designed so that
you can boot up a team in a couple of days. Get your Backlog, plan your first
Sprint, and away you go.

DON'T
You don’t need to devote a lot of time to planning,
reflection, meditations, mission statements, or five-year projections.
