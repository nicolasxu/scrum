This after-the-fact billing has
become the center of so much cost that companies and agencies have set up
Change Control Boards. From a cost point of view, it makes sense. Limit the
number of changes, and you’ll limit the cost associated with them.


What the bean counters don’t realize is that they’re setting up a system
that is designed to deny people what they actually want. They’re trying to
limit cost, but in doing so, they’re limiting learning, innovation, and
creativity.
