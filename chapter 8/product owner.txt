The Product Owner needed to be
able to deliver feedback to the team from the customer each and every
Sprint.


They needed to spend half their time talking to the people buying
the product (getting their thoughts on the latest incremental release and
how it delivered value) and half their time with the team creating the
Backlog.


But I didn’t want a manager. I wanted someone the team would believe
and trust when he prioritized the Backlog.



The Scrum
Master and the team are responsible for how fast they’re going and how
much faster they can get. The Product Owner is accountable for translating
the team’s productivity into value.
