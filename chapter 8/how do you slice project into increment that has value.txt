The key is to look for what slices
actually hold value—enough value that you can get real feedback on them
and react in real time.

delivery in fifteen months, faster than any delivery they’d ever done.

The key is not to have a fully established design at the beginning
but, rather, to make a functional prototype, then see what you can improve.
