Emotional waste

That type of waste is generated when a company
has an asshole in its midst—someone who likes spinning up other people
and putting them in a tizzy. Assholes often justify their behavior by claiming
they’re simply trying to make people work better. But they’re merely
indulging the negative aspects of their personality, and nothing is more
undermining of a team’s ability to excel.
