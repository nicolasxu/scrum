… no matter how excellent your technicians, you who are leaders must
strive for advances in the improvement of product quality and
uniformity if your technicians are to be able to make improvements.
The first step, therefore, belongs with management. First, your
company technicians and your factories must know that you have a
fervor for advancing product quality and uniformity and a sense of
responsibility for product quality.
Nothing will come of this if you only speak about it. Action is
important.

- W. Edwards Deming

PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act).
Plan what you’re going to do. Do it.
Check whether it did what you wanted. Act on that and change how
you’re doing things. Repeat in regular cycles, and, by doing so,
achieve continuous improvement.
