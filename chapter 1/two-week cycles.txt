two-week cycles


at the end of each cycle, there would be a finished increment of product.



That
meant they’d have something working, something that could be shown to
anyone who cared to look but certainly the stakeholders and, optimally, the
people who’d actually be using the thing.

In Scrum we call these cycles “Sprints.”


At the beginning of each cycle
there is a meeting to plan the Sprint. The team decides how much work
they think they can accomplish during the next two weeks.
