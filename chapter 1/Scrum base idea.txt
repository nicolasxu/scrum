At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a
project, why not regularly check in, see if what you’re doing is heading in
the right direction, and if it’s actually what people want? And question
whether there are any ways to improve how you’re doing what you’re doing,
any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from
doing that.

That’s what’s called an “Inspect and Adapt” cycle
