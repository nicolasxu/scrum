Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early

Corporate culture often puts more weight
on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation
that can be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not
produce real value is madness. Working product in short cycles
allows early user feedback and you can immediately eliminate what
is obviously wasteful effort.
