Traditionally, management wants two things on any project: control
and predictability. The problem is that the rosy scenario never actually unfolds



Every project involves discovery of problems and
bursts of inspiration. Trying to restrict a human endeavor of any scope to
color-coded charts and graphs is foolish and doomed to failure.



All that
effort poured into planning, trying to restrict change, trying to know the
unknowable is wasted.


Projects are delayed, come in over budget, and, in too many cases, end in
abject failure. This is especially true for teams involved in the creative work
of crafting something new.
